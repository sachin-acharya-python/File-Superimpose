# File Merger

This script allows you to add all your files inside an image which can be viewed as an image as well as function as an archive file (`.rar`).

## How to use
Rename the file from the image to `.rar` to use as an archive. Rename back to image to use as image.

For, thumbnails, currently, only JPEG and PNG are used. Can be changed to any Image Format for the thumbnail.
